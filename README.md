Curried Font
===

A font forked from Terminus, WenQuanYi-bitmap, CtrlD (which is in turn forked from Dina).

* CurriedCN (9pt, 12px) is the mixture of Terminus and WenQuanYi-bitmap for CJK characters.
* Curried (10pt, 13px), (12pt, 16px) is [CtrlD](http://github.com/bjin/ctrld-font).
* Curried (20px, 24px, 28px, 32px) is based on Curried (16px) and should be used with Retina displays.

They are patched with powerline glyphs.

Some custom glyphs made for my xmobar came with CurriedCN:
    * U+E500 for playing
    * U+E501 for paused
    * U+E502 for stopped
    * U+E503~U+E50B for progress (0..8)
    * U+E50C for mute
    * U+E510~U+E513 for signal (0..3)

Future custom glyphs should reside in the Unicode private area (U+E000~U+F000).
